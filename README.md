# React.js Frontend Project

This project is a modern, secure web application built with React.js, designed for scalability and maintainability. The application includes robust features such as routing, multilingual support, API handling with Axios, JWT-based authentication, and more.

## Key Features

- **Routing**: Implements client-side routing using `react-router-dom`, allowing for efficient navigation within the application.
- **Multilingual Support**: Supports multiple languages using `react-i18next`, enabling the application to cater to a global audience.
- **API Integration**: Handles API requests seamlessly with Axios, including support for JWT authentication.
- **JWT Authentication**: Manages user authentication and authorization using JSON Web Tokens (JWT), ensuring secure access to protected routes.
- **State Management**: Uses Context API or Redux for managing global application state efficiently.
- **Responsive Design**: Built with a mobile-first approach, ensuring the application is accessible and user-friendly across all devices.
- **Environment Variables**: Utilizes environment variables to manage configuration settings across different environments (development, staging, production).

This project is designed to be a robust and scalable frontend solution for modern web applications.

## Getting Started

Follow the steps below to set up and run the application on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) version 16.15.0.
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) or [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/)

### Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**

   - Clone the repository from GitHub:
     ```bash
     git clone https://github.com/mujahidfarooqi/React.js-FrontEnd
     cd your-repo
     ```

2. **Install Dependencies**

   - Install the required npm packages:
     ```bash
     npm install
     ```

### Running the Application

1. **Start the Development Server**

   - Run the following command to start the application in development mode:
     ```bash
     npm start
     ```
   - The application will be available at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

### Building the Application

1. **Create a Production Build**

   - To create a production-ready build, run:
     ```bash
     npm run build
     ```
   - This will generate a `build` folder containing the optimized application.

### Multilingual Support

1. **Adding New Languages**

   - To add a new language, create a new JSON file in the `src/i18n/locales` directory and add the necessary translations.
   - Update `src/i18n/i18n.js` to include the new language.

Example:

```javascript
import i18n from 'i18next';
import { initReactI18next } from 'react-i18next';
import en from './locales/en.json';
import fr from './locales/fr.json';

i18n.use(initReactI18next).init({
  resources: {
    en: { translation: en },
    fr: { translation: fr },
  },
  lng: 'en',
  fallbackLng: 'en',
  interpolation: {
    escapeValue: false,
  },
});

export default i18n;
